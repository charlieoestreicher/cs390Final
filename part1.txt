John Huang, Charlie Oestreicher

The Part I coding summary should include information about the design of your program, obfuscation
techniques used, at least one strategy of how another team could successfully find the location by
using SRE techniques, and any other information your team feels is relevant to explaining your
project and your understanding of SRE. This write-up should also include a bulleted list of what each
team member contributed to the development/design process

compare its value...
