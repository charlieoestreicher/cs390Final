No code needed. This should instead be a brief outline of how your program will
work, addressing questions like those below. It is expected that this plan will 
evolve and change over time.
IV. Sub-Assignment Details

- how will you obfuscate strings?

We will certainly use some of the strategies we have gone over throughout class
such as putting strings on the stack in small chunks, encrypting/decrypting
strings....


- how will you check the user's password?

We can use strcmp. What are other options?


- how will you prevent the user from printing the location with a simple jump to 
the print statement?

??????


- how will you display the location? (lat/long? a password that opens a map file? 
a written description of where to go?)

We are considering either a written description of where to go or providing a 
link to an image. 


- which obfuscation techniques would you like to incorporate, and how will you do 
this?

Bloated equivalents will most likely be implemented after our source code is
complete. Our strategy will be to attempt to reverse our own code by going 
through the assembly and identifying areas where we can use bloated equivalents
to further obfuscate our code.

Random predicates. 

Garbage code insertion is an easy addition that we will make throughout the 
development of our project. We will be sure to regularly analyze the executable
with Ghidra to make sure that our garbage code is not useless. 

Opaque predicates. 

Control flow manipulation.
