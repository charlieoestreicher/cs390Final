No code needed. This should instead be a brief outline of how your program will
work, addressing questions like those below. It is expected that this plan will 
evolve and change over time.
IV. Sub-Assignment Details

- how will you obfuscate strings?


- how will you check the user's password?


- how will you prevent the user from printing the location with a simple jump to 
the print statement?


- how will you display the location? (lat/long? a password that opens a map file? 
a written description of where to go?)


- which obfuscation techniques would you like to incorporate, and how will you do 
this?
